We started developing Georadio a year ago to ensure the high-quality data supply required for our research. Georadio is a mobile application based on Bluetooth technology that, acting as a moving detector, identifies Bluetooth devices around, then transmits detected MAC ID-s of devices along with the mobile phone's location data to a server. Data processing follows the European and domestic data protection regulations and the legal interpretation of the CMS law firm (see the attached Resolution, available only in Hungarian). We developed Georadio as a mobile application, but we are working towards elaborating a hardware solution.
During a two-round competition with Georadio, we entered the Proof-of-Concept programme of Óbuda University, during which we examined market utilisation and the general framework of patenting. In addition, with Georadio, we won the open call of the NEANIAS European Open Science Cloud program (Horizon RIA), where we examine research infrastructure and service applications that can be built upon location data collection.

To move forward, we needed to test the application to assess how large a population we can detect by Georadio and how large a fleet of devices is required to collect a reliable sample. We elaborated a three-day test on July 19-21, 2022. For those three days, we asked collegues to run Georadio anonymously on Android mobile phones. Since the program is designed for hardware and not for mobile devices, it was not necessary to get developed for iOS.

App stores mark Georadio as a potentially dangerous application due to location data sharing. The same application stores, however, enable applications frequently used by Open Source Intelligence without drawing attention to cybersecurity threats. The difference between these – most of all, fitness and navigation – application and Georadio is that, while the former hide the consent to data sharing with third parties, Georadio detects location data and equipment identifier by openly indicating the purpose of data collection (see Privacy Policy, available only in Hungarian). The application is safe to use and can be removed from your mobile phone quickly and entirely with one click at the end of the test.

At the webmap the results of the three-day test is presented. 

We detected a total of 20,448 different Bluetoot devices (BTs) during the 3 days by 13 active sensor devices.
A BT device - not trivially the detector itself - furthest detections: 151 km, 112 minutes apart, a Forerunner 35.

Most BT detections of 1 user within 1 second:
- Westo, 67 BT, Astoria
- deneb, 56 BT, Kelenföld railway station
- Pokatylov, 52 BT, Westend Shopping Center
- Matei, 39 BT, Erzsébet körút, Stifler Pool

Most BT detections of 1 user within 1 minute (all different BTs):
- Pokatylov, 201 BT, Westend Shopping Center
- Westo, 142 BT, Astoria

There were 10 BT devices detected by 3 users and 213 BT devices detected by 2 users.
Example: 
Pokatylov detected the 'OPPO A15s mobile phone' device at the southern corner of the Westend, with an accuracy of 23m, then approx. 3 hours later, the same device was detected by Kocsmárosé, close to the crossing in front of Nyugati, with an accuracy of 25m. 

Among the 213 BT devices detected by 2 users:
- 63 unknown BT names,
- 37 Lime scooters,
- 35 TVs (at least those that are easily recognizable),
- 17 TIER scooters,
- 3 KKSLOCK (MOL Bubi),
- 3 Huawei,
- 2 MIBOX4, etc.

GEORADIO's impact

The industrial application of geolocation data is almost inexhaustible. The global location data analytics market is expected to grow from $ 13.52 billion in 2021 to $ 36.22 billion by 2028. The amount and variety of location data are increasing exponentially, and acquiring and analysing costs are declining steeply. In parallel with the business use of data analysis technologies, their broader social application is gaining ground. 

Based on growth prospects and market receptivity, location-based marketing and location intelligence are the most inclusive sectors to accommodate Georadio and profiling and recommendation techniques. Location-based marketing sets up behavioural movement profiles from individual mobility history. Based on profiles, targeting personalised messages, real-time reflection on customer needs can be provided. Personalisation implies the customisation of the marketing content by different technical means by evaluating individual's data or inferences to predict the behaviours of the users. 

Targeting and personalisation characterise the marketing communications sector globally. The leading players here are the data-driven, software- and MI-centric marketing agencies. They are the informed, professional facilitator of the online advertising market and orchestrators of diverse communication channels.

Specific goals to be reached by locational intelligence and location-based marketing:
-	Immediate traffic growth with real-time profiling and addressing: the technique informs the user about nearby businesses and sends targeted offers.
-	Display Relevant Ads: Send more relevant and personalised ads with real-time positioning, controlled by time and space parameters (proximity, frequency, time).
-	Attracting customers from the competitor to increase market share: addressing customers heading towards the competitor's business with a better offer.
-	Better user experience, improved customer retention: personalised experience according to mobility and location preferences.

In the forthcoming years, Geo IoT is expected to grow by 24% (CAGR) in the service market. The global Geo IoT market is predicetd to reach $ 67.8 billion by 2028. Business services (marketing, business consulting and communication services) represent a new, fast-growing field of application for the geolocation data industry. The number of users is constantly growing on offline activity tracking platforms. 

The most crucial decision point on the location-based marketing and location intelligence market is data provision, whether or not a third party uses or acquires self-generated input data. That determines the business model used in the process of implementation. Involving an external data source can put the developer in a vulnerable position and raise the price level to an unsaleable level. In the case of self-generated data, the choice of sensing technology affects the business model. The decisive factors will be spatial and temporal resolution, aggregation resulting from personal data protection, and representativity. 

Georadio is a software application that opens up user profiling for a wide range of business applications, such as multichannel marketing in retail, real estate and fintech sectors. The disruptive use of long-established Bluetooth technology provides valuable data for industries with no exploitable access to big locational data. Georadio detects individuals' presence in urban environments, both indoor and outdoor. By doing so, it maintains privacy, unlike other technologies built on questionable practices of individuals tracking.  Sensitivity to private life is a core value of Georadio. Instead of trajectories, Georadio operates with point maps showing the presence of individuals at points of specific interest. Since each individual's appearance pattern is unique, human behaviour can be segmented, leading to lifestyle profiles. We can differentiate lifestyle profiles such as 'Commuting employee', 'Suburban entrepreneur', 'Data-dependent teenager', 'Garden city home office employee' etc. The advanced profiling method enables detecting an individual's need before it arises. 

Privacy is a key issue in collecting, managing, processing, and transmitting location data and is governed by many laws, regulations, directives, and recommendations. Data protection regulations vary sectorally and geographically. Fintech (financial technology), for instance, applies the most protective data protection practices globally. The European Union's laws are also outstandingly stringent in a global comparison. The current General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union strictly protects citizens' personal data. Location data is personal data, access to which requires the user's explicit consent in almost all cases. However, many applications require automatic sharing of location data, with or without a valid reason. The rise of the location data market is due to the proliferation of applications that provide minimal benefits to the user, which at the same time often force the user to approve access to data by misleading or obscuring essential points. As a result, customers become more aware of sharing geolocation data.

Beyond data collection issues, the right to equal treatment and non-exclusionary customer management are critical points in locational intelligence. Personalisation operates by evaluating individual standards, usually elaborated by automated decision making (unsupervised learning algorithms). Customers are given targeted recommendations that are picked up as an outcome of tagging, scoring and automation. Automation decision making in business practice can result in stigmatisation or exclusion. To avoid this, GDPR set up a regulatory framework that disadvantages unsupervised learning applications favouring human intervention procedures.
